## Summary

I am very excited to present this application. The completion of this project was very challenging and taught me a lot about using Node to access APIs and deliver specific information to the browser. This is my first project using a server side framework.

I ran into many road blocks building this, but with persistence and the desire for the end result, I was able to overcome them. It improved my skills as a developer tremendously and I look forward to creating more applications using Node to continually improve as a programmer. I am happy to say that I have leveled up in my experience, and I look forward to getting better and better.
